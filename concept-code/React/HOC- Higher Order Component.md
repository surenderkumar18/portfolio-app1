**to share common functionality between multiple components without repeating code**
_They promote reusability by encapsulating logic in a separate function_

# Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a design pattern in React

[HOCs are functions that accept a component as an argument and return a new component with enhanced functionality.]()

**Basic Structure**

1.  `A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component.`
2.  `The returned component can render the original component along with additional props, state, or behavior.`

**Purpose:**

1.  `HOCs are used to share common functionality between multiple components without repeating code.`
2.  `They promote reusability by encapsulating logic in a separate function that can be applied to multiple components.`

# Basic Use Cases

1.  [Authentication]
2.  [Logging]() : `You want to log props changes for debugging or analytics purposes.`
3.  [Error Handling]()
4.  [Theming]
5.  [Fetching Data]() : `You want to fetch data from an API and pass it down as props to your component.
