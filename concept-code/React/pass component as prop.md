# Icon

`custom Button should also support icons. Therefore, an Icon prop is extracted from the incoming props. It's called Icon (with an uppercase "I") and not icon (lowercase "i") because this prop should hold a component identifier (i.e., a pointer at a component function) as a value.`

`The goal therefore is to use this Icon prop value as a component inside the Button component. In addition, if the Icon prop is set, the CSS classes are again extended to add the icon-button class:`
