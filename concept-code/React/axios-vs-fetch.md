# Fetch API:

**Native Browser Support:**
`The Fetch API is a modern browser API built into the JavaScript environment, so it doesn't require any additional libraries or dependencies.`
**Promise-based:**
It returns promises, making it easy to work with asynchronous code and allowing you to use modern JavaScript features like async/await.
**Lightweight:**
Since it's built into the browser, it's lightweight and doesn't add extra overhead to your application bundle.
**Streaming Responses:** It supports streaming responses, allowing you to start processing the response body before it's fully downloaded.
**Browser Compatibility:**
While Fetch is well-supported in modern browsers, it may require polyfills or fallbacks for older browsers.

# Axios:

**Feature-rich:**
Axios is a standalone JavaScript library that provides a wide range of features, including request and response _interception_, _automatic JSON parsing_, and _built-in support for handling errors and timeouts_.

**Works in All Environments:**
Axios can be used not only in browser-based applications but also in Node.js environments, making it suitable for universal (isomorphic) applications.
**Simplifies Common Tasks:**
It simplifies common HTTP request tasks, such as setting headers, handling authentication, and managing request and response data.
**Interceptors:**
Axios allows you to intercept requests or responses before they are handled, which is useful for tasks like adding authentication tokens or logging.
**CSRF Protection:**
Axios provides built-in protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks by automatically adding CSRF tokens to requests.
