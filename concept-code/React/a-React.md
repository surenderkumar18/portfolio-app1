[User Interface](), [declarative UI programming](), [imperative programming]()
`Browser :` react.new

`React is a JavaScript library` _for building user interfaces_, `especially single-page applications where dynamic content needs to be rendered efficiently.`

[User Interface]() : `A user interface (UI) is the means through which a user interacts with a computer, system, or device. It includes the visual elements, commands, and interactions that allow a user to control and communicate with the software or hardware. User interfaces are designed to be intuitive and efficient, making it easier for users to accomplish their tasks.`

**React = declarative UI programming**

`In React,` _declarative UI programming_ `means describing the desired state of the user interface (UI) and letting React take care of updating the UI to match that state. Instead of specifying the` _step-by-step instructions_ `for how the UI should change`. In _(imperative programming),_ `you declare what the UI should look like for a given state, and React handles the rendering process.`

# QUESTION

1.  `Dynamic FORM`?
2.  `when you create Header.css & include in <Header> component, all css style or css classes are abailable to <Product> component as well.`
    - _so css styles are not scoped to component only_
3.  `Two way data binding?`

4.  `<button className="btn" onClick={handleSubmit}>Click Me</button>`
    - `default 'type' of button 'submit'`
    - `we can make it type submit/button`
5.  `Inside FORM we use button`
    - `To reset FORM, (suppose you enterd few field, but you want to fill it again from begining)`
    - `Create a button and make its type as reset`
      - `<button type="reset">Click Me</button>`
      - `It's browser built in type`
