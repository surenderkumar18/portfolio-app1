# useCallback

`useCallback is used to` memoize a function, `preventing it from being recreated on every render`. _This is useful when passing callbacks to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders._

# useMemo

`useMemo is used to` memoize a value, _preventing expensive calculations from being executed on every render._ `It returns the memoized value.`
