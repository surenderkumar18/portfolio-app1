[Cannot be Used as Constructors]()

# Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

**Characteristics**

[Immediate Execution](): `The function runs immediately after it is defined.`
[Scope Isolation](): `Creates a new function scope, which is useful for avoiding variable collisions in the global scope.`
[Self-contained](): `Can contain private variables and functions that are not accessible from the outside.`

# Arrow Functions

**Characteristics**

[Concise Syntax](): `Shorter and more readable syntax, especially for small functions.`
[Lexical this Binding](): `Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this context. They inherit this from the surrounding scope.`
[No arguments Object](): `Arrow functions do not have their own arguments object.`
[Cannot be Used as Constructors](): `Arrow functions cannot be used with the new keyword.`
