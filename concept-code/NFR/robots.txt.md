`robots.txt is a text file that website owners create to instruct web robots (typically search engine crawlers) on how to crawl and index pages on their website. This file plays a crucial role in controlling how search engines interact with the site’s content, which can impact the site's visibility in search results.`

`Each record starts with a User-agent line, followed by one or more` Disallow or Allow lines.

[Directives]:

`User-agent:` _Specifies which web crawler the following directives apply to._

_Disallow_: `Tells the web crawler not to access a particular URL path.`
